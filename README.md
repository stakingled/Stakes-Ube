ERC-20 / BEP-20 Staking
Staking for Standard ERC-20 / BEP-20 tokens

What is Ube Smart Contract?

The Stakes Smart Contracts allow ERC-20 / BEP-20 token holders to be able to create a Stake and gain interest, based on a predefined APY.
Features

Administrator user can define the parameters of the contract:

    APY: annual percentage yield, or annual percentage interest, calculated per second
    Maturity: users can claim rewards only if they remain staked for at least this number of days
    Minimum amount to create a stake
    ERC-20/BEP-20 token to stake

Architecture

Imagine a site owner who has a token for a particular project, the owner can create a Stake contract, define an annual interest rate, and approve some funds for the contract.

Then the token holders can create Stakes, depositing an amount of tokens in the contract and accruing interest while the tokens are staked, once the Stake is finalized, the token holders will receive their original amount plus the interest earned. A penalty may be applied if stakes end before a predefined maturity period.
